Unlike other brain actuated applications, we used a MPU 6050 instead of brainwaves to control the direction of movement as it reduces the number of sensors required for brainwave measurement considerably, thereby reducing the overall cost. We used a Biofeedback headset to measure the brainwaves, using Electroencephalography (EEG). These are forehead bands that measures the brain activity. Using Pantech Solutions developed EEG headset we measured and monitored the Alpha waves, frequency ranging from 7 Hz to 13 Hz, and mapped them to the speed of the wheelchair."

This problem is further compounded by the fact that braille printers are prohibitively expensive - generally starting from two thousand US dollars, beyond the reach of the common man. Over the period of a year, the authors have tried to develop a Braille printer which attempts to overcome the problems inherent in commercial printers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to introduce two prototypes -The first with an emphasis of costeffectiveness, and the second prototype, which is more experimental and aims to eliminate several demerits of Braille printing. The first prototype has been constructed at a cost significantly less than the existing commercial Braille printers."

The unsolved cube matrix can also be manually entered into the program and the cube can be placed in the bot. The bot consists of dc motors as rotors to rotate the sides of the cubes and Ardunio Mega as the interface between the code and the motors."
