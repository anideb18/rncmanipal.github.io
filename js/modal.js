Unlike other brain actuated applications, we used a MPU 6050 instead of brainwaves to control the direction of movement as it reduces the number of sensors required for brainwave measurement considerably, thereby reducing the overall cost. We used a Biofeedback headset to measure the brainwaves, using Electroencephalography (EEG). These are forehead bands that measures the brain activity. Using Pantech Solutions developed EEG headset we measured and monitored the Alpha waves, frequency ranging from 7 Hz to 13 Hz, and mapped them to the speed of the wheelchair."
